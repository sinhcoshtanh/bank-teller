# bank-teller
Emulating transactions that are performed between a bank-teller and a customer.

Gaining direct inspiration from [ssilvacris](https://github.com/ssilvacris/Finance-Projects/blob/master/bank_teller_Cris.ipynb), here is my best attempt to model, plan, and draft a bank teller simulation. This is with the goal of advancing further my Python 3 functions and control flow skills. 

## The Plan

1. Initialise the savings and checking account values
2. Check balance function
3. Deposit function
4. Withdrawal function
5. Transfer between accounts
